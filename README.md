## Project Overview
Smart Cookie Jar is an IoT-based snack monitoring system designed to help users manage their daily snack intake. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller to detect snack removal via a load cell and sends this data to a Flask-based server. The server logs snack consumption, tracks calories and sugar, and enforces a user-defined daily snack limit by activating a locking mechanism when the limit is reached. Additional features include a refill reminder, OLED display with lock status and remaining snacks, red and green LEDs for visual status indication, and a web dashboard that provides snacking analytics such as peak snacking times and nutritional trends. The system is designed for a single user and emphasizes low power consumption, simplicity, and clear user feedback.

## Features
- Set daily cooikes consumption amount
- Auto lock when hitting the limitation
- Feedback on the cookie consumption
- UI display

## Data processing
- Flaks will be used as the backend server, it would get data from the ESP32 and send back the data analysis results.
- The user interface or web pages will be rendered by Flask.
- SQLite would be the database which stores all the cookie intake info.
